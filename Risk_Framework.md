### **Elevator Pitch for the CEO**  

**Right now, registries hold vast amounts of company and director data but lack real visibility into the risks they’re exposed to.** Our risk framework changes that by turning raw registry data into **actionable insights**.  

We systematically assess risks—such as **high-risk locations, financial instability, and politically exposed directors**—and assign clear risk scores to companies and individuals. This allows registries to **proactively identify threats, prevent fraud, and ensure compliance** without relying on manual reviews.  

By leveraging **automation and data-driven scoring**, we help registries move from **reactive oversight to proactive risk management**, ensuring they stay ahead of financial crime and regulatory risks.

### **Data-Driven Risk Framework for Registries**  

Many **registries** today operate without clear insights into the risks they may be exposed to—whether from companies registered under their jurisdiction or the individuals managing them. Our **risk framework** transforms raw registry data into actionable intelligence, helping registries proactively identify **high-risk entities** and mitigate potential threats.  

### **How It Works**  
We systematically assess risk at both the **company** and **director** levels by analyzing key risk factors:  

#### **Company-Level Risk Factors**  
1. **Location Risk** – Identifies companies registered in jurisdictions with known financial crime risks.  
2. **Financial Risk** – Highlights businesses with weak financial performance, which may indicate instability.  
3. **Company Age** – Flags newly formed entities that might be fronts for fraudulent activity.  

#### **Director-Level Risk Factors**  
1. **Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) Match** – Detects directors with political ties that increase corruption risk.  
2. **Nationality Risk** – Identifies directors from high-risk jurisdictions.  
3. **Appointment Patterns** – Monitors frequent board changes that may indicate ownership obfuscation.  

### **Why This Matters for Registries**  
Registries often maintain vast amounts of company and director data but **lack real-time risk visibility**. Without structured risk analysis, they may inadvertently enable **money laundering, fraud, or shell company activities**. Our framework:  
✅ **Automates risk detection**—reducing manual review efforts.  
✅ **Provides a clear, structured risk score** for companies and directors.  
✅ **Enables proactive compliance and oversight**, reducing exposure to illicit activity.  

### **Data-Driven Implementation**  
Using **dbt**, we transform raw registry data into risk insights through:  
1. **Data Cleansing & Standardization** – Ensuring consistency across company, director, and financial data.  
2. **Risk Factor Computation** – Assigning risk scores based on predefined criteria.  
3. **Risk Aggregation** – Producing an overall risk profile for entities within the registry.  

By **unlocking hidden insights** in registry data, this approach empowers registries to enhance **compliance, oversight, and risk prevention**, ensuring a more transparent and secure business environment.
