-- We join directors with the PEP staging model to flag politically exposed individuals. 
-- A simple matching on first and last name could serve as a starting point.
-- We could further refine this model by including additional logic 
-- based on the directorâ€™s nationality (joined with our country_codes seed) if needed.
